## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Browsify AI (the "Extension"), a browser automation assistant designed to help users optimize their usage of ChatGPT Plus/Pro accounts. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use the Extension.

By installing or using Browsify AI, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms, please uninstall or discontinue use of the Extension.

## 2. Information We Collect

### a. Automatically Collected Information

- **Browser Interactions:** The Extension may access certain web requests or tab information strictly for the purpose of enabling ChatGPT Plus/Pro automation features, such as displaying conversation data in the side panel.  
- **Local Storage:** We may store your user preferences (e.g., configuration settings or saved workflows) in your local browser storage so that your personal settings remain consistent across sessions.

### b. User-Provided Information

Browsify AI does not require you to create an account or provide personal identifiable information (e.g., your name or email) within the Extension itself.

### c. No Sensitive Data Collection

- We do not intentionally collect any sensitive personal data, such as credit card details, health information, or authentication credentials.  
- We do not modify your original ChatGPT requests; the Extension only intercepts requests to enable side panel display for conversation content.

---

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data exclusively to:

- **Provide Core Functionality:** Automate and streamline ChatGPT Plus/Pro interactions within your browser.  
- **Improve User Experience:** Store user settings locally, so your chosen configurations persist between sessions.

We do not use or share your data for any unrelated purposes such as marketing, advertising, or analytics beyond the Extension's single purpose.

---

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

- **No Third-Party Sales:** We do not sell, rent, or transfer any user data to third parties outside of the scope of the Extension's core functionality.  
- **No Third-Party Integrations:** The Extension does not transmit your data to external services or servers. All relevant data processing happens locally in your browser, except for the direct interaction with ChatGPT's official website or API, as initiated by the user.

---

## 5. Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect user data stored locally:

- **Local Storage:** Your settings and preferences remain in your browser's local storage, which is secured by your browser environment.  
- **No External Logging:** We do not maintain external servers or logs capturing personal data or browsing history.

However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Browsify AI is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have unintentionally collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly remove the information.
